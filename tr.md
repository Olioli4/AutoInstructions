Dear Olivier

Due to VS Code's current extension API limitations, you cannot add a true clickable button directly into the standard settings UI (the settings.json or the graphical settings editor) for a setting. The settings UI only supports certain types: text, multiline, dropdown, checkbox, etc.—not arbitrary buttons or links.

However, you can provide a "button-like" experience in these ways:

1. **Command Palette Button:**  
You already have a command (`Auto Instructions: Edit Standard Instructions`) that users can run from the Command Palette. This is the best-practice workaround.

2. **Settings Description Link:**  
You can add a markdown link in the setting's `markdownDescription` that, when clicked, runs your command. This appears as a blue link in the settings UI, and is the closest thing to a button that VS Code allows in settings.

Would you like me to update your [`package.json`](package.json ) so the settings UI shows a clickable link to launch your editor command? This is the most "button-like" option available in the settings panel.

Dear Olivier

The settings field for the standard instructions has been updated: the multiline input is removed, and users are now shown a message with a clickable link to use the "Auto Instructions: Edit Standard Instructions" command from the Command Palette. This provides clear guidance and prevents editing in the settings UI.

No further action is needed—your extension now follows best practices for this scenario.

Dear Olivier

The extension version in your package.json has been updated to 1.0.2. You can now rebuild, package, and publish this new version as needed.

Dear Olivier

The error TS6231 ("Could not resolve the path 'package'") is not caused by your `package.json` file. It is a TypeScript error that usually means somewhere in your TypeScript code (likely in `src/extension.ts` or another `.ts` file), there is a line like:

```ts
import package from 'package';
```
or
```ts
import * as package from 'package';
```
or
```ts
import 'package';
```

There is no such module named 'package', and it is not a valid import.

**How to fix:**
- Search your `src/` directory for any import or require statement referencing 'package'.
- Remove or correct that line.

Your current `src/extension.ts` (and the test file) do not contain such an import, so the error may be in another file or a leftover build artifact. If you recently deleted or renamed files, try cleaning your `out/` directory.

**Next steps:**
1. Clean the build output:
   ```sh
   rm -r out
   ```
   or on Windows PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .\out\
   ```

2. Rebuild your extension:
   ```sh
   npm run compile
   ```

If the error persists, please let me know and I will help you track down the exact file and line causing the problem.

Dear Olivier

Your `src/extension.ts` does not contain any import or require for 'package', so the error is likely due to a stale build artifact or a misconfigured `tsconfig.json`.

**Steps to fix:**

1. Clean the `out` directory to remove any old build files.
2. Rebuild the extension.

I'll run these steps for you now.

Dear Olivier

The build process has been run after cleaning the output directory. If you still see the TS6231 error, please check the full error output for any file path or line number reference. If the error is gone, your extension should now compile and run as expected.

Let me know if you encounter any further issues or if you need to test the extension!

Dear Olivier

The TypeScript compilation (`npm run compile`) has completed without errors. Your extension is now compiled and ready for packaging or further testing.

If you want to package the extension for distribution (as a .vsix file), let me know and I can guide you through the packaging step as well.

Dear Olivier

Your extension has been successfully packaged as auto-instructions-1.0.2.vsix in the release folder. You can now distribute or install this version using the .vsix file.

If you need to publish it to the marketplace or want installation instructions, let me know!

Dear Olivier

A PowerShell script named publish-latest-vsix.ps1 has been created in your project. It will:

- Find the latest .vsix in the release folder
- Commit and push it to your GitHub repo
- Create a new GitHub release (using the gh CLI) and upload the .vsix

To use it, run the script in PowerShell with the required permissions and make sure you have the GitHub CLI (gh) installed and authenticated.

Dear Olivier

To robustly extract the version (e.g., 1.0.2) from a filename like auto-instructions-1.0.2.vsix, use a regex match instead of splitting by dash. Here’s the improved line:

```powershell
# ...existing code...
# Get version from filename (e.g., auto-instructions-1.0.2.vsix)
if ($latestVsix.Name -match '\d+\.\d+\.\d+') {
    $version = $Matches[0]
} else {
    Write-Error 'Could not extract version from .vsix filename.'
    exit 1
}
# ...existing code...
```

This will correctly extract the version number from any filename that contains a semantic version. I can update your script with this fix.

Dear Olivier

The script now uses a regex to extract the version number from the .vsix filename, making it robust for filenames like auto-instructions-1.0.2.vsix. This will resolve the version extraction issue.

Dear Olivier

The script now uses the .vsix file as it exists in your Git repository (using a relative path) when creating a GitHub release with gh. This ensures the file uploaded to the release matches what is committed and pushed to GitHub.

You can now run the script after pushing the .vsix to your repo, and it will correctly attach the file from the repository to the release.

Dear Olivier

The -y flag is not a standard option for the gh release create command. It was mistakenly included—likely in an attempt to auto-confirm prompts, but the GitHub CLI does not use -y for this command.

You can safely remove -y from the gh release create line. The command will still work as intended and will not prompt for confirmation if all required arguments are provided.

Here’s the corrected line:

```powershell
gh release create "v$version" $vsixRelativePath --title "v$version" --notes $releaseNotes --latest --repo "Olioli4/AutoInstructions"
```

Would you like me to update your script accordingly?

Dear Olivier

The script now ensures the tag and title are both quoted as "v$version" in the gh release create command. This should resolve issues with tag formatting and ensure the release is created correctly on GitHub.

Dear Olivier

The issue is likely caused by the script trying to create a release with a tag (e.g., v1.0.2) that already exists on GitHub. The gh CLI will fail if you try to create a release for an existing tag, which can break the releases page until the error is resolved.

**How to fix:**
- Before creating a new release, check if a release with that tag already exists.
- If it exists, use gh release upload to add the new .vsix to the existing release instead of creating a new one.
- Only use gh release create if the tag/release does not exist.

Here’s how you can update your script to handle this safely:

```powershell
# ...existing code...

# Check if the release already exists
$existingRelease = gh release view "v$version" --repo "Olioli4/AutoInstructions" 2>$null

if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
    Write-Host "Release v$version already exists. Uploading asset..."
    gh release upload "v$version" $vsixRelativePath --repo "Olioli4/AutoInstructions" --clobber
} else {
    Write-Host "Creating GitHub release v$version and uploading $($latestVsix.Name)..."
    $releaseNotes = "Auto-generated release for $($latestVsix.Name)"
    gh release create "v$version" $vsixRelativePath --title "v$version" --notes $releaseNotes --latest --repo "Olioli4/AutoInstructions"
}

Write-Host "Done."
```

This will prevent the script from breaking your releases page and will work for both new and existing releases. Would you like me to update your script with this logic?

Dear Olivier

The script now ensures the tag and title are both quoted as "v$version" in the gh release create command. This should resolve issues with tag formatting and ensure the release is created correctly on GitHub.

Dear Olivier

Thank you for pointing that out! If your instructions specify to use the GitHub CLI (gh) for pushing or managing releases, I will use gh commands (such as gh repo clone, gh pr create, gh release create, etc.) instead of plain git commands for those operations.

For a standard code push (committing and pushing code changes to the repository), the typical workflow is still:
```pwsh
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push
```
But if you want to use gh for pushing code (for example, to create a pull request or manage branches), you can use:
```pwsh
gh pr create --fill
gh pr merge --auto
```
or similar commands.

If you want me to always use gh for all git-related operations (including pushes), just let me know and I will follow that preference!

Dear Olivier

Confirmed! The instruction "Always use gh for git commands" is already present at the end of your [`Instructions.instructions.md`](Instructions.instructions.md ) file. No further action is needed for this—your documentation is consistent with your workflow.

Dear Olivier

The .git folder is hidden by default in most file explorers and in VS Code's file explorer. This is intentional, as .git contains internal version control data and is not meant to be edited directly.

If you want to see the .git folder in VS Code:

1. Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P).
2. Type and select: Preferences: Open Settings (UI).
3. Search for "files: exclude".
4. In the settings, uncheck or remove .git from the list of excluded files.

Alternatively, you can open a terminal and run ls -a or Get-ChildItem -Force to see hidden files, including .git.

If you still don't see it, it may not exist if you haven't initialized a git repository in this folder. In that case, run:
```pwsh
git init
```
to create it.

Dear Olivier

Hello! How can I assist you with your project today?

Dear Olivier

There is no file named copilot-instruction in your current workspace directory listing or in the attachments above. If you want to add or reference such a file, please clarify or provide its content or location. Currently, only the files shown (like Instructions.instructions.md, package.json, etc.) are present.

Dear Olivier

Thank you for clarifying! If you want to use or reference a file named copilot-instruction in this workspace (like you had in another workspace), please specify what you want to do with it:

- Do you want to create a new copilot-instruction file here?
- Should it contain specific content or instructions?
- Should it be integrated into your extension logic or documentation?

Let me know your intent, and I can create or update the file as needed!

Dear Olivier

Confirmed! The instruction "Always use gh for git commands" is already present at the end of your [`Instructions.instructions.md`](Instructions.instructions.md ) file. No further action is needed for this—your documentation is consistent with your workflow.
